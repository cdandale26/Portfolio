# Getting Started with Portfolio Project:

The project uses React, Tailwind CSS and libraries like Emailjs, Sweetalert to create some visual effects on the website. The website has a link to most of the projects that I have been working on lately along with the links to where the websites are hosted.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### The site is published at https://cdandale.netlify.app/
